# Assignment 2 — Data Wrangling: Dendrometer Data

## Objective
This project combines multiple raw dendrometer `.csv` files into a single tidy dataset and saves it as an `.rds` file for downstream analysis. 
The goal is a fully reproducible pipeline that others can run without changing paths.

## Repository contents
- `scripts/01_processing/data_processing.R` — a script that reads, cleans, and combines the raw CSVs and writes `data/processed/dendrometer_combined.rds`.
- `data/Dendrometer_Data/` — the raw dendrometer CSV files (input).
- `data/processed/` — the output directory for the combined `.rds` created by the script.
- `docs/data_dictionary.csv` — an auto-generated list of columns and types to aid the README.
- `README.md` — this file.

## Clean data columns
Below are the column names of the cleaned data, with data types and brief descriptions. The table below is auto-generated from `docs/data_dictionary.csv`.

> **How to fill this section:**  
> 1) Run `scripts/01_processing/data_processing.R`.  
> 2) Open `docs/data_dictionary.csv`; add short descriptions.  
> 3) Paste a Markdown table of the updated dictionary here once I know what the column names should be (need to ask Ken probably)
